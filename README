[Introduction]

You should do this part AFTER you finish fixing all the bugs.
Use "git rebase" to squash all commits whose message starts with "make some conflicts in ..." into a single commit and re-write its message to "make a lot of conflicts before merging master branch into this branch"

Then, use "git merge" to merge "master" branch into this "git_practice" branch. You may encounter some conflicts in several files.
After you fix the conflicts, commit it and leave the message unchanged as default.

Finally, you can run the "submit.sh" script to examine your work
