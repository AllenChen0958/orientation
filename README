
[Introduction]

There should have been some source files in the git repository, but I accidentally delete them.
Trace the git log and recover them with whatever method you like except for the "git reset" with "-hard" flag.
After recovering the missing files, add a new commit with the message "Start challenge"
Make sure the message is exactly the same. Use copy-and-paste is recommended.
